Most of my work has been in inventory, supply chain, pricing and financial trading.  
I am a strong believer in developing a diverse toolbox of skills to solve advanced
analytic problems.  Here is a variety of old and new examples that I can share.

Some projects in progress and not publicly available that may be of interest:

- Performance of code can be critical.  I have one project that is comparing
  the performance of a Python API to a Go API.
- I have an interesting NLP project that used a custom corpus for sentiment.  
  the final results were surprising.
- The last trading system has a reflection paper in the works.  It is being
  written in journal style.
- I have notes on a short piece regarding a little known book on data science
  business strategy.  The "Big Data MBA" book had a poor title but great
  content.  A reflection piece on this will be forthcoming.
- I have a custom timeseries plot to share.  I had to solve a unique
  visualization problem.  This particular plot showed the power of plotly for
  some tasks that used to be much more challenging.
